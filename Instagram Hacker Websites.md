## **1️⃣ Use a Strong and Unique Password**  

A weak password makes your account **vulnerable to brute force attacks**. Protect yourself by using:  

✅ At least **12-16 characters**  
✅ A mix of **uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols**  
✅ A password that **doesn’t include personal details** (like your name or birthday)  

📌 **Best practice:** Use a **password manager** like **1Password, LastPass, or Bitwarden** to generate and store strong passwords.

## **2️⃣ Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) 🔐**  

2FA adds **an extra layer of security**, requiring a second verification step to log in. Even if someone steals your password, they **can’t access your account without the second factor.**  

🔹 **How to enable 2FA on Instagram:**  
1️⃣ Go to **Settings → Security**  
2️⃣ Tap on **Two-Factor Authentication**  
3️⃣ Choose **SMS or an authentication app** (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)  
4️⃣ Follow the prompts to activate 2FA  

💡 **Pro Tip:** **Authentication apps** are more secure than SMS, as hackers can intercept text messages.
